SCREENCONNECT ONE-LINE LAUNCHER
================================

Copy and paste this single line into ScreenConnect's PowerShell command window.
Make sure to update the GitHub URL with your actual repository raw file URL.

METHOD 1 - Direct Download and Execute (Recommended):
------------------------------------------------------
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bepoz-deployment-tools/main/ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1'))"


METHOD 2 - Download, Save, and Execute:
----------------------------------------
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$f='C:\Temp\BepozLauncher.ps1';mkdir C:\Temp -Force|Out-Null;(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bepoz-deployment-tools/main/ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1',$f);& $f"


METHOD 3 - Using Invoke-RestMethod (PowerShell 3.0+):
------------------------------------------------------
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bepoz-deployment-tools/main/ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1 | iex"


INSTRUCTIONS:
=============
1. Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
2. Ensure the repository name matches (default: bepoz-deployment-tools)
3. Ensure the branch is correct (default: main - some repos use 'master')
4. Make sure ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1 is in the root of your GitHub repository
5. The repository must be public, OR the ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1 must have the GitHub token embedded

TESTING THE COMMAND:
====================
Before using in ScreenConnect, test locally by:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Paste the command
3. Verify the toolbox launches correctly

SECURITY NOTES:
===============
- Method 1 (Recommended): Executes directly from memory, no file left on disk except the main toolbox
- Method 2: Saves launcher to disk first, useful for troubleshooting
- Method 3: Shortest syntax, requires PowerShell 3.0 or higher
- All methods use -ExecutionPolicy Bypass to avoid script signing issues

ALTERNATIVE - Manual Upload:
=============================
If you prefer not to use one-line launchers, you can:
1. Download ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1 to your local machine
2. Use ScreenConnect's "Send File" feature to upload it to the client
3. Run it with: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\ScreenConnect-Launcher.ps1"
